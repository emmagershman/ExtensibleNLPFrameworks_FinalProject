My Dear Little Girl,

I suppose by this time that you are sound asleep in [your] bunk and enjoying dreamland. Well, I’m not going to “waste” much time over this so after a few little scratches, will hit the sheets myself.

… About six of the boys received their “marching orders” tonight and tomorrow go the the Dr.’s office to be examined for the front. They join the medical corps. Some of them expect to leave for England Saturday.

I do hope that when you receive this you will be feeling a little better than you were when I telephoned today. For the life of me, I couldn’t make out what was up, whether you didn’t want to say something that someone might hear or whether you felt rather, on the other hand, that perhaps something was wrong with the person at the end of the line. I’d have rung you up later again to try to reach a conclusion, if it were not probable that you would have been in bed.

However, I’ll know tomorrow.

Now Little Girlie, I must take this out to the box and file into bed. It’s freezing tonight so I supposed that means snowshoeing. Sorry, I want to be able to get over some night — but it’s a no go for the present.

Good night for this trip,

Reg
