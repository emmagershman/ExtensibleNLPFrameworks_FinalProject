My Dear Little Girl,

First and most important, I suppose that you have heard the news. This time I think that it is sure and that we will be on the water some time this side of Sunday. That is about all I can think of at present. It does not seem possible, after so many disappointments that we are really going. The boys seem to be going crazy; by tomorrow there will be no holding them. There is to be a parade of every man in the battery then and the news will come to us officially.

My, it is so long since I have seen you and so long since I promised to write you and again so long since talking with you that it is hard to find much to write about. Writing is at its heart but a very poor apology for speech and when I think that it will be but a short time till I can tell you all the news, my pen fails in its attempt to note down what I will only repeat on Friday if not sooner.

That Friday would be the last time the two saw one other for 10 months. Days later, Reg shipped out aboard the S.S. Caledonia to serve in the Royal Canadian Artillery. He describes being surrounded by nothing “but sea and sky … Men are stretched out on deck in all shapes and forms, some sleeping, others reading and, again, many writing.”

But before he left Nova Scotia, Reg and Helen had a very memorable goodbye, a moment he carried with him aboard the Caledonia and moved his writing to passion as well.
