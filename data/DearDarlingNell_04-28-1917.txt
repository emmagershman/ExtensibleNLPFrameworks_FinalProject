My Dear Darling Nell

I am writing these lines hoping to find you and all our dear little ones in the very best of health.  I am very sorry to know that you have not been getting much news from me but love I write to you all I can at present the conditions we are now in we do not get much chance of writing any letters. 

Well love my foot is progressing very slowly but lately I have been very bad in health for the conditions I have had to go through out here is gradually telling upon my constitution for I reckon I have stood it well up till now but I feel as I am getting beaten. 

Oh love how I wish that this terrible anxiety and suspense was over for I do long to be with you and our deal little ones who are continually in my mind it is as you state in your letter it is a shame we should be parted for such a long time and I have done over my bit as you know but it seems no matter how long or what you have been through out here they are never done with you. 

The men we have got with us now have only been out here two months and they have done nothing or been through anything yet but they are continually grousing and fed up with it.  They have been forced to join the army so you can guess what they are like. 

Well love let us put the troubles aside and hope for a peaceable time for us both and all for if I am lucky enough to get through it alright I hope to have a happy and loving life with you and our dear little ones for you know I love you and I always will and I know you do me for you have proved it with my little ones. 

Well love this is all at present with my very best love to you and my little ones. 

I am you ever loving husband Fred Swannell. 

Kisses for you love and my little ones.

Love you all
